            <h2 id="what">What is Hive Learning Network NYC?</h2>
              <p>
              <strong><em>
              Peer-to-peer educator collaborations creating networked communities for innovation.
              </em></strong>
							<p>
Hive NYC members develop and share new ways to teach problem-solving and creativity, giving young people the skills to read, write and participate in the digital world.
              </p>
              <h3>Network for Learning | Network that Learns</h3>
              <p>
              The flagship program in Mozilla's growing community of city-wide learning networks, Hive NYC operates across institutions and settings.
							</p>
							<p>
From code clubs to science museums, over two hundred educators, designers, makers, artists, technologists, librarians and teachers from across New York City participate, representing organizations with a wide variety of missions, youth populations, institutional sizes, disciplines, strategies and areas of expertise. 
</p>
            
            <h2 id="core">Core Values and Principles</h2>
            
              <p>
              Hive NYC is a living laboratory, a community building and testing together, strengthening programs and practices, and spreading what we discover.
</p>

<h3>Every participant within Hive NYC is an educator and a learner</h3>

<p>
In both program development and professional practice, community members engage with the principles of connected learning and web literacy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>learning through hands-on, inquiry-based making</li>
<li>using digital tools and the web</li>
<li>working together with peers on shared purpose, based on strengths and expertise</li>
<li>stimulating learners on their interests</li>
<li>self-directed learning, helping youth to gain the skills to explore work, education and civic participation</li>
<li>equality of access for those ordinarily under-served</li>
</ul>
<div class="well">
<p>
Hive NYC programs are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Innovative</strong></li>
<li><strong>Meaningful</strong></li>
<li><strong>Participatory</strong></li>
<li><strong>Open</strong></li>
</ul>

</div>
            <h2 id="vision">Vision and Goals</h2>
              <p>
              Over the next five years, Hive's goals are to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mobilize</strong> more educators to adopt connected learning practices and teach web literacy within a growing constellation of Hive Learning Networks.
</li>
<li><strong>Create</strong> high-quality connected learning and web literacy tools, content, curriculum and practices for broad use.
</li>
<li><strong>Catalyze</strong> schools, youth programs, and city agencies to provide rich connected learning and web literacy programs, especially in under-served communities.
</li>
<li><strong>Grow</strong> demand for Hive Learning Events, Communities and Networks in new locations and sectors.</li>
</ul>
              
            <h2 id="how">How Does Hive NYC Work?</h2>
            
            <p>
            Community members fuel and drive the network through active participation. Hive NYC HQ provides an infrastructure of support:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>regular channels for exchange</li>
            <li>platforms for experimenting</li>
            <li>learning from exemplars</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            These include regular events such as design charettes, sharing of expertise and professional development opportunities, and openly networked collaboration including co-designing programs.
            </p>

						</p>
						
            <h2 id="why">Why Mozilla</h2>

</p>
<p>
Hive NYC is locally connected and globally networked, building educators' ability to create digitally rich programs for youth, not only in NYC but around the world. As the flagship program in the Hive Learning Networks ecosystem, Hive NYC is a model for others hoping to build similar communities.
